# Hamiltonian-Cycle-Problem
Aim:
Consider a scenario in the field of logistics, where a delivery truck needs to visit a set of
cities to deliver packages and return to the starting city, aiming to minimize the overall travel
distance. The problem is to find the most efficient route that visits each city exactly once and
returns to the starting city. This problem can be modeled as the &quot;Hamiltonian Cycle Problem&quot;
and can be addressed using the backtracking approach. Implement the solution for this
problem.
